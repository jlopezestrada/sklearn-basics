## Categories

### 1. Supervised Learning
This category includes algorithms where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training sample is paired with the output it should predict. Examples include regression and classification algorithms.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms are used when the training data is not labeled, and the system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data without any explicit instructions.

- Directory: `unsupervised_learning/`

### 3. Semi-Supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning falls between supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a small amount of labeled data supplemented by a large amount of unlabeled data.

### 4. Reinforcement Learning
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve some goals. The agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from explicit teaching.
